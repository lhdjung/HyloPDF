// The recolouring ramp, as a compute shader.
//
// A faithful port of `recolorByPixel` in `themes.ts` — the same Rec. 601 luma
// rounded rather than truncated, the same white point, the same HSL room, the
// same fade between the colour floor and the colour ceiling. It reads a page
// texture and writes the recoloured page.
//
// The tables the CPU path builds once per theme are computed per pixel here.
// That is the whole difference, and it is deliberate: a lookup on the GPU is a
// texture fetch and a dependent read, while the arithmetic is a handful of
// instructions on a unit that has nothing else to do. The ramp entries are
// rounded to eight bits anyway, so the two paths still meet at the same value.

// Two vec4s and nothing else, so that there is one possible layout rather than
// a std140 rule to be right about: `w` on the ink carries whether colour is
// kept, and `w` on the paper is spare.
struct Theme {
    // The theme's ink, 0..1, with `keep_colour` in `w`: 1 when a pixel that
    // has a colour of its own keeps it, 0 when everything is flattened onto
    // the ramp, which is what a link and a selected word want.
    text: vec4<f32>,
    // The theme's paper, with `w` carrying the one thing that is not a
    // colour: above 0.5 the pixel is left exactly as it arrived. A theme that
    // does not recolour still goes through this shader, because the same pass
    // is what turns pdfium's BGRA into the RGBA a texture is read as — the
    // swizzle that used to be a walk over every pixel on the CPU.
