// The parts of a page that are painted through a ramp of their own.
//
// **Three things in the app want this and all three are saying the same
// thing** — *this part of the page is different*, in a colour the theme chose.
// A link (`tintLinks`), a passage the reader has marked (`tintMarkup`) and a
// word they have swept over (`paintSelection`). What they have in common is
// that the colour the page was printed in is exactly what must not survive: a
// link that keeps the blue it was printed in says nothing. So this is
// `duotone` in `themes.ts` — the ramp before it learned to keep a colour.
//
// **A pass of its own rather than a branch in `recolor.wgsl`.** The obvious
// arrangement hands the recolouring pass a list of rectangles and asks every
// pixel whether it is in one, and a bibliography page has a couple of hundred
// links: two hundred rectangle tests against ten million pixels, for work
// that touches perhaps a fiftieth of the page. So the dispatch is over the
// *runs* instead, stacked one above another into a grid that is the sum of
// their areas and nothing else — which is the same economy the app gets from
// a clip, arrived at the only way a compute pass can.
//
// **And it reads from wherever the untouched pixels are.** A link is tinted
// from the page as pdfium drew it, which is still on the GPU while the page
// is being uploaded — the pristine copy `tintLinks` takes, without the copy.
// A selection is ramped from the page *as shown*, because a recoloured dark
// page is already light ink on dark paper and the selection has to sit on
// what the reader can see; there the untouched pixels are a backup taken
// before the ramp went on. Each run carries where to read as well as where to
// write, which is the whole of the difference.

struct Runs {

    // carried rather than measured.
