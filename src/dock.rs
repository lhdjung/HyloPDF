//! A "New Window" item on the icon in the Dock, above the standard ones.
//!
//! The app's `dock` module, moved across almost unchanged — and the "almost"
//! is the interesting part. There, the item calls `spawn_window(&app)` on a
//! thread of its own, because it is invoked on the main thread and
//! `spawn_window` asks the windows where they are, which is a question only
//! the main thread can answer. Here it posts to the shell proxy, which is the
//! same answer arrived at from the other side: a window can only be made from
//! inside a winit callback, so *everything* that asks for one posts an event.
//! The Dock item needed no special case at all.
//!
//! Everything else stands. Neither winit nor Tauri reaches `NSApplication`'s
//! `dockMenu`, so this goes to the Objective-C runtime directly. A menu item
//! needs a *target*, and a target is an object with a selector on it — so one
//! class is built at runtime, one instance of it is made, and both are left
//! alive for as long as the process is.
//!
//! It is also the only place in this reader that writes "New Window" in title
//! case. The Dock menu is the system's furniture and is spelled the system's
//! way.
