//! The renderer, with one thing put right on the way through.
//!
//! **A frame that fails to reach the screen is not thrown away, and the next
//! one is drawn on top of it.** `render` in `anyrender_vello_hybrid` resets
//! the scene only after a successful present, and there are two early returns
//! before that — a surface texture that cannot be had, and a present that
//! fails. So a window whose surface has gone away accumulates one whole frame
//! per redraw in a single scene until `vello_common` asserts:
//!
//! ```text
//! thread 'main' panicked at vello_common-0.1.0/src/strip.rs:205:
//! `alpha_idx` too large
//! ```
//!
//! — a `u32` running into the bit `Strip` packs its fill flag into, at about
//! two billion. The way to see it is to leave the reader open and let the
//! display sleep; the app dies while nobody is looking at it. Blitz declines
//! to paint an *occluded* window, which is the case macOS reports; this is the
//! case it does not, and a `Timeout` from `get_current_texture` during any
//! hiccup poisons the scene the same way and never recovers.
//!
//! The fix upstream is to reset on those two paths. From outside the crate the
//! one hook is that the draw closure is handed the scene, so this wrapper
//! resets at the *start* of every frame. The base colour is filled back in
//! because the reset takes the inner renderer's own fill with it.
//!
//! Everything else here is delegation, written out only because
//! `WindowRenderer` has eight methods and no blanket impl.
