//! Composed input, which both of this experiment's documents called the one
//! thing it was blocked on.
//!
//! `dioxus-assessment.md` said "IME does not exist — no `compositionstart` /
//! `update` / `end`", and `PROGRESS.md` carried it as the single item that
//! needed a decision rather than a workaround: a reader who writes Japanese,
//! Chinese or Korean composes every word in a candidate window, and a find bar
//! that cannot take a composition cannot be searched in those languages at
//! all. That was true of Blitz once and is not true of the revision this tree
//! is pinned to. This file is the evidence, and it is here rather than in
//! `tests/search.rs` because what is being asked about is the *input path*
//! and the find field is only the one place this reader currently has to ask
//! it from.
//!
//! What arrives is not a DOM `CompositionEvent` and never will be — the DOM's
//! composition events are a *notification* that a composition is under way,
//! and Blitz instead applies the composition to the focused element's editor
//! through Parley and tells the application about the result. The reader wants
//! the result. Nothing in `app.rs` had to change for any of this to work,
//! which is why there is no source change beside these tests: the find field
//! is an ordinary `<input>` with an `oninput` handler, and a committed
//! composition is an `input` event like any other.
